This repository contains the analysis code for *"A cortico-subcortical loop for motor control via the pontine reticular formation"*

### Folder Structure

- `analysis_code`: Contains raw code snippets.
- `data`: Contains all .csv and .rds files that the code uses to generate figures.
- `publication_figures`: Contains the code for generating figures along with detailed explanations and tests. This will serve as the source for the final figure generation codes used in publications.
- `supplementary_functions`: Custom-written functions used for the analysis.
- `useful_to_load`: Color matrix for figures. Not utilized; can be ignored.

### Publication Figures

The `publication_figures` folder contains the following key files:

- `electrophysiology_figures.Rmd`: Analysis notebook for electrophysiology figures (Fig 3, 4, 6, S2, S3, S5)
- `freely_moving_IL_photoactivation_figures.Rmd`: Analysis notebook for freely moving IL photoactivation figures (Fig 7)
- `freely_moving_PnO_photoactivation_figures.Rmd`: Analysis notebook for freely moving PnO photoactivation figures (Fig7, S6)
